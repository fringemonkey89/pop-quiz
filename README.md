 Hello Strangers! My name is Marko Majetic and I have created a quiz testing your knowledge on web development using Javascript, HTML and CSS. This timed quiz contains four questions and each question has four answers to choose from.Once the quiz is completed, you will enter your initials and your information will be
stored locally and your initials, along with your score, will displayed.If you wish to try the quiz again, there is a play again button that will reset the quiz
to the beginning.

   you see a window screen pop up that contains an alert that informs youchow much
   time you are given and the time penalty for answering a question incorrectly

   answer, you will see if you answered it correctly, or, incorrectly
 - When the quiz is finished, either by submitting all four questions early, or,the
   time expiring, you will see an input with a submit initial button below it
